          A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like
          these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am
          alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created
          for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so
          absorbed in the exquisite sense of mere tranquil existence, that I
          neglect my talents. I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke
          at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater
          artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour
          around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the
          impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal
          into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by
          the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand
          unknown plants are noticed by me: when I hear the buzz of the little
          world among the stalks, and grow familiar with the countless
          indescribable forms of the insects and flies, then I feel the presence
          of the Almighty.

          One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams, he found
          himself transformed in his bed into a horrible vermin. He lay on his
          armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his
          brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections.
          The bedding was hardly able to cover it and seemed ready to slide off
          any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of
          the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened
          to me?" he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room
          although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar
          walls. A collection of textile samples lay spread out on the table -
          Samsa was a travelling salesman - and above it there hung a picture
          that he had recently cut out of an illustrated magazine and housed in
          a nice, gilded frame. It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and
          fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the
          whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.
